        <h2 class="section1-header">What is a Version Control System?</h2>
        <p>In modern web development, developers often have to juggle multiple different projects often collaboratively with other developers or designers. Using a VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same projects without the risk of conflicts and lets us keep several versions of our code which we can revert back and forth. It is also handy to have multiple versions of the same product to allow us to make changes and test things out without affecting the source code of a product which may already be live.</p>
        <p>Version control systems come in a variety of shapes and sizes but are usually either <strong>Local</strong> or <strong>Remote.</strong> The two most commonly used VCS programs are <strong>Git</strong> which is open sourced and developed by the creators of Linux, and <strong>GitHub</strong>  which is currently supported by Microsoft.</p>

        <h3 class="section3-subheading">Standardised practices for using Git Workflows</h3>
        <p>Now that we know what Git & GitHub are, how they work, and why they are so useful. We now need to look at the best practices for using Git & GitHub within our own workflows. Although many of the fundamentals will remain the same, there are processes such as what to name our branches, the roles these branch fulfill, and how and when the branches should be merged which may differ between developers. </p>
        <p>As with the use of linters and formatters in our code, having a clearly defined and standardised process within a team of developers helps to prevent conflicts, allows us to more easily bugfix and identify issues within the worfklow, and generally improves the efficiency of collaboration.</p>
